netCrawla

What in netCrawla? 

It is an online database that simplifies the available online data for cybersecurity professionals through specific key fatcors and searches. This may narrow down the time needed to find the proper search results faster. 

This search engine is able to track varous IP addresses, operating systems, network devices, and much more while selecting them by country, state and city. I hope to have a simplistic webpage format so that data can be readily available to the end user. I hope for the main site to be minimal on the eyes in terms of words, but at the same time visually pleasing and stimulating. 

Additionally, it will notify the user, once permission is given to do so, to check to see if that person’s device and other devices connected to the same network (for an additional fee, potentially) are publically exposed on the internet. If they are exposed, then send user to the proper site/ online resource to fix this issue. After while the user is on the site from there on, it will display Lurk notListed onto top of the left side of the page add the user is using the site. There will be a turn off option for this feature.
